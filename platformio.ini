[env:TLB_R01_release] ; TODO: figure out why it's boot-looping in release mode. It's not even reaching Serial.begin(), just right after the 'entry 0x403c98d0' line at boot

; appears to have fixed itself??? maybe it's temperature (because i left it overnight before retying), or maybe it's the recent platform commits https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/releases/tag/2.0.15

; driver notes: see https://mydicedevice.com/?p=514
; the ESP32-S3 has a built-in JTAG debugger and serial port. This is wonderful, but the drivers are a little tricky
; out of the box (and after 'uninstalling drivers' from device manager), the ESP shows up as 2 devices: a 'USB Serial Device (COM#)' and 'USB JTAG/serial debug unit'
; if the 'USB JTAG/serial debug unit' is under the 'Universal Serial Bus devices' group, it won't work.
; using Zadig, i changed the drivers for the JTAG device ('interface 2' for the ESP32-S3 built-in) to libusbK instead of WINUSB
; see the screenshots in the 'extra docs/JTAG driver fixes' folder
; P.S.:
; i identified the JTAG device, by going to device manager -> device properties (of JTAG device) -> Details -> Device instance path ---> note ending number (usually 0002)
;  e.g. 'USB\VID_303A&PID_1001&MI_02\6&33C85812&0&0002'. So in Zadig, i selected 'USB JTAG/serial debug unit (Interface 2)'
